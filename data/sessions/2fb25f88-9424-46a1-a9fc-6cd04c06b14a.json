      "summary": "This reading highlights a journey from grounding in reality to embracing your voice and ultimately considering the broader implications of your choices. The 'Country' card emphasizes the importance of stability and recognizing what is true in your life, which sets a solid foundation for the present. With the 'Cockatoo' in the present, there's a call for clear self-expression and asserting your needs, suggesting that your voice is a crucial tool in shaping your relationships and environment. Looking ahead to the 'Whale,' you are encouraged to think long-term, understanding that meaningful change often requires patience and a focus on legacy rather than immediate results.",
